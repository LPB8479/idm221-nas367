## Transit Maps
This project started with a challenge to design a subway map showing all current and future passenger rail services in the Washington, DC/Baltimore region in a clean, unified and easy to understand manner. While based on Lance Wyman’s original Washington Metro map and my own artistic style, I heavily drew inspiration from Massimo Vignelli’s New York Subway map.

The success with my Washington map inspired me to create a map for the Philadelphia region in the same style. With additional inspiration coming from SEPTA's upcoming rebrand, this map proved extra challenging due to the numerous Regional Rail lines running through the core of the city. While this project is essentially completed, I do hope to revisit this sometime soon, especially to find a way to show the B line's service patterns in a way that stays within the style limitations already in use.
## Flame Animation
A project aiming to visually animate a word or phrase. I used a slower frame rate on the letters themselves to imitate the 'flickering' of a fire, and added the growth to represent the ignition of the flame.
## Freight Sans
A type-only poster highlighting a unique typeface by Joshua Darden. I used positive and negative space to create a visually interesting composition.
## Vignelli
An exercise in creating a photorealistic rendering of a portrait. I chose to highlight Massimo Vignelli, a famous graphic designer who has inspired some of my other works.
## Clay Studio
A hypothetical logo design project for a non-profit art studio in Philadelphia. The project's goal was to create three logos to embody the character of the organization.
## Amtrak
A multi-page, interactive redesign of Amtrak’s website and booking process. My main goals were to reduce the clutter on the page and to streamline the booking process.
## Noguchi
A simple type-only poster advertising a hypothetical exhibition about the work of artist Isamu Noguchi. In this poster I pushed the boundaries of the letters together, resulting in an interesting pattern in the whitespace.
## Panton Chair
A poster advertising a hypothetical exhibition about the revolutionary stacking chair by Verner Panton. The design uses the motion of the upside-down form of the chair to draw the viewer’s eye towards the exhibition information.
## PhillyRR
A collection of photos exploring abandoned railroad infrastructure and remnants in and around Philadelphia. I find it really interesting what railroads demolish vs leave as-is when closing a rail line.
## Smeg
A multi-page, interactive redesign of SMEG’s product page and checkout process. The main goal for this project was to create a standard user experience while not being visually overwhelming to the consumer.
