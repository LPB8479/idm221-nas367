## Work
### Graphic Design
#### Clay Studio
A hypothetical logo design project for a non-profit art studio in Philadelphia. The project's goal was to create three logos to embody the character of the organization.
#### Freight Sans
A type-only poster highlighting a unique typeface by Joshua Darden. I used positive and negative space to create a visually interesting composition.
#### Noguchi
A simple type-only poster advertising a hypothetical exhibition about the work of artist Isamu Noguchi. In this poster I pushed the boundaries of the letters together, resulting in an interesting pattern in the whitespace.
#### Vignelli
An exercise in creating a photorealistic rendering of a portrait. I chose to highlight Massimo Vignelli, a famous graphic designer who has inspired some of my other works.
#### Robot
An exercise in creating a photorealistic rendering of a 3D object in 2D.
#### Panton Chair
A poster advertising a hypothetical exhibition about the revolutionary stacking chair by Verner Panton. The design uses the motion of the upside-down form of the chair to draw the viewer’s eye towards the exhibition information.
#### Washington Metro Map
A project aiming to design a map showing all current and future passenger rail services in the Washington, DC/Baltimore region in a clean, easy to understand manner. While based on Lance Wyman’s original Washington Metro map and my own artistic style, I heavily drew inspiration from Massimo Vignelli’s New York Subway map.
### Web and App Design
#### uNav
A redesign and user experience animation for a new navigation app. My goal was to combine the features of Google Maps and Citymapper into one app, creating an all-in-one navigation and travel utility.
#### Amtrak
A multi-page, interactive redesign of Amtrak’s website and booking process. My main goals were to reduce the clutter on the page and to streamline the booking process.
#### Smeg
A multi-page, interactive redesign of SMEG’s product page and checkout process. The main goal for this project was to create a standard user experience while not being visually overwhelming to the consumer.
#### Portfolio Redesign
A mockup of my work-in-progress redesign of my portfolio website. My goal is to create a site that unifies my work and shows it in a comprehensive manner.
### Photography
#### Color
`These photos aren’t part of a group or anything and there’s not much to say about them. I will most likely put all 4 photos on one page without text.`
#### Black & White
##### PosNeg/VolScale
Some experimental photos exploring the concepts of scale and positive/negative space. I tried to demonstrate these technical concepts in a creative and interesting way.
##### PhillyRR
A collection of photos exploring abandoned railroad infrastructure and remnants in and around Philadelphia. I find it really interesting what railroads demolish vs leave as-is when closing a rail line.
