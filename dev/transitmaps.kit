        <p>This project started with a challenge to design a subway map showing all current and future passenger rail services in the Washington, DC/Baltimore region in a clean, unified and easy to understand manner. While based on Lance Wyman’s original Washington Metro map and my own artistic style, I heavily drew inspiration from Massimo Vignelli’s New York Subway map.</p>

        <p>The success with my Washington map inspired me to create a map for the Philadelphia region in the same style. With additional inspiration coming from SEPTA's upcoming rebrand, this map proved extra challenging due to the numerous Regional Rail lines running through the core of the city. While this project is essentially completed, I do hope to revisit this sometime soon, especially to find a way to show the B line's service patterns in a way that stays within the style limitations already in use.</p>
